<img src="/profile.jpeg" class="h-80 mx-auto rounded-md" alt="Priyanshu Sinha" />

Priyanshu Sinha is a senior at [Delhi Technological University (Formerly DCE)](https://dtu.ac.in), where he is doing a major in electrical engineering and a minor in economics. He recently completed a summer internship at [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/) India, where he learned that coffee and circuit schematics make a surprisingly powerful combo.

He led [Team Raftaar](https://teamraftaar.in/) in 2024 as the Vice-Captain to design and build hybrid recumbent bikes that aim to be faster than your average pizza delivery. The team won several competitions globally.

When he's not knee-deep in circuits, you'll find him geeking out over Formula 1, dissecting movie plots, and exploring pop culture's quirkiest corners.
