This post serves as an ever-expanding collection of resources I've discovered and used to learn analog electronics. Please note that this is simply a compilation, you don't need to go through everything listed here. Each resource is helpful at different stages of your learning journey. I’ll also share what worked for me along with my recommendations, in case you find that useful. Since this list is continuously growing, I’ll keep updating it as I come across new materials. If you’d like to suggest a resource, feel free to email me.
